# OddEve

This is a simple Python script which I wrote on a whim, It plays **oddeve** with you. Yes, oddeve.
Purely CLI based, haven't made a GUI yet, will do so soon. 
*You should know how to basically operate a CLI if you are gonna play this :)*

## How am I supposed to play this?

Get **oddeve.exe** from the Releases page, and run it. 
#### OR
If you aren't comfortable with running an exe, (fair enough) just download **oddeve,py** and run it via-
```python oddeve.py```
You will need the "time" and "random" libraries.

### Enjoy :D
